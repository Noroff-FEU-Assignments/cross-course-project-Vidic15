    <p>Welcome to my first website.</p>
    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">It is important to be aware of threats on the web and to have focus on web security. Therefor you should be aware of the most common security threats Cross-site scripting, SQL injection and Cross-site request forgery. 

        Attacking threats can be mitigated through your web server configuration by enabling HTTPS. There is also vulnerability scanner tools that are publicly available, using this can help you discover if you have made any obvious mistakes. As a user you should always be aware of any clickable links on a webpage. Check if it has https in the address.
        
        So what can you do to prevent attacking threats? You can use more effective password management and encourage use of strong passwords. I would consider using a two-factor authentication for your website. This could be a code sent to the users phone. HTTPS encrypts data sent between client and server. This ensures login credentials, cookies, request data and header information is not easily available to attackers.
        
        It is a good idea to involve everyone in security practices. This helps to keep everyone updated and aware of threats. You can automate and integrate security tools. This ensures that you wont forget to scan a web application before it is published and overall you will save time. The key tool for web application security is the vulnerability scanner. This is a very useful tool. You can also perform security exercises where you hire an external organization that can challenge your security and have a local that is in charge of stopping the attacking attempts.
